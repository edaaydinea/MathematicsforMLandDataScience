    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "- **Definition**: The mean is the average value of a data set. It represents the point where a distribution balances.\n",
    "- **Formula**: For a discrete random variable $X$ with values $x_i$ and corresponding probabilities $p_i$:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Mean} = \\mu = \\sum (x_i \\cdot p_i)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "- **Calculation Example**: \n",
    "  - For ages of kits: 3 kits of age 0, 2 kits of age 1, 4 kits of age 2, 1 kit of age 3.\n",
    "  - Mean age: $\\frac{(3 \\cdot 0) + (2 \\cdot 1) + (4 \\cdot 2) + (1 \\cdot 3)}{10} = 1.3$.\n",

    "### Expected Value\n",
    "- **Definition**: The expected value (or mean) of a random variable gives a measure of the central tendency of its distribution.\n",
    "- **Notation**: $E(X)$ or $\\mu$.\n",
    "- **Example**: For a game with a 50/50 chance of winning $10 or $0:\n",
    "  - Expected value = $0.5 \\cdot 10 + 0.5 \\cdot 0 = 5$.\n",
    "  - This is the fair price you should be willing to pay to play the game.\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  where $f(x)$ is the probability density function (PDF).\n",
    "- **Uniform Distribution**: For a uniform distribution between $a$ and $b$:\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- **Expected Value**: The mean of a probability distribution, representing the balancing point of the distribution.\n",

    "## Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expected Value (Mean):**\n",
    "   - It represents the average outcome you would expect if you were to repeat an experiment or game many times.\n",
    "   - In the example of the two games:\n",
    "     - **Game 1:** Win $1 or lose $1 with equal probability → Expected value = $0\n",
    "     - **Game 2:** Win $100 or lose $100 with equal probability → Expected value = $0\n",
    "   - Both games have the same expected value of $0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - Variance measures how much the outcomes of a random variable spread around the expected value.\n",
    "   - It is calculated as the average of the squared deviations from the mean.\n",
    "   - For **Game 1**, the variance is calculated based on deviations of ±1 squared, which is 1. Thus, variance = 1.\n",
    "   - For **Game 2**, the variance is based on deviations of ±100 squared, which is 10,000. Thus, variance = 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Variance Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spread of Outcomes:** The variance quantifies the spread or variability of outcomes. A higher variance indicates more spread, while a lower variance suggests outcomes are more clustered around the mean.\n",
    "- **Comparison of Variances:** Even with the same expected value, games or distributions can have different levels of risk or variability, which is captured by variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Calculation of Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition of Variance:**\n",
    "   - Variance is computed as:\n",
    "     $$\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^2]$$\n",
    "   - This involves:\n",
    "     1. Calculating the deviation of each outcome from the mean.\n",
    "     2. Squaring each deviation.\n",
    "     3. Averaging these squared deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Formulation:**\n",
    "   - Variance can also be computed using:\n",
    "     $$\\text{Var}(X) = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2$$\n",
    "   - This is often easier to calculate in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Transformation of Random Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect of Scaling and Shifting:**\n",
    "  - If you multiply a random variable $X$ by a constant $a$, the variance of the new variable $aX + b$ is $a^2 \\times \\text{Var}(X)$.\n",
    "  - Shifting (adding a constant) doesn’t affect the variance, but scaling (multiplying by a constant) increases the variance by the square of that constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "  - If you roll a die and win double the roll minus $5:\n",
    "    - The variance of the net winnings $Y$ is four times the variance of the roll $X$ since $Y = 2X - 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding variance helps you gauge the risk or reliability of an outcome. For instance, in investments or game design, variance provides insight into how much uncertainty or risk is associated with different options."

    "2. **Standard Deviation**: \n",
    "   - **Definition**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of spread in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: For a random variable $X$, the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)}\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **68-95-99.7 Rule**:\n",
    "   - **68%** of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean ($\\mu \\pm \\sigma$).\n",
    "   - **95%** of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean ($\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$).\n",
    "   - **99.7%** of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean ($\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Spread**: The standard deviation helps to understand the variability or spread of data points around the mean. For example, in measuring heights, a smaller standard deviation means that people’s heights are more similar to each other, while a larger standard deviation indicates greater diversity in heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability and Data Analysis**: In statistical analyses and probability, knowing the spread of data (via variance and standard deviation) is crucial for making predictions and understanding the reliability of data.\n"

    "\n",
    "In your scenarios, the lottery and car insurance games exhibit different risk profiles despite having the same expected value and variance. To differentiate between these two scenarios, we need to consider higher-order moments, particularly the third moment, which measures skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap of Moments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Moment (Mean):**\n",
    "   - For both the lottery and car insurance, the expected value is $0$.\n",
    "   - **Lottery:** $-1 \\times 0.99 + 99 \\times 0.01 = 0$\n",
    "   - **Car Insurance:** $-99 \\times 0.01 + 1 \\times 0.99 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Moment (Variance):**\n",
    "   - The variance of both scenarios is the same, $99$.\n",
    "   - **Variance Calculation:** For both distributions, the variance is computed as:\n",
    "     $$\\text{Var}(X) = \\text{E}[X^2] - (\\text{E}[X])^2$$\n",
    "     Since $\\text{E}[X] = 0$, $\\text{Var}(X) = \\text{E}[X^2]$, which is $99$ in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Moment (Skewness):**\n",
    "   - The third moment measures the asymmetry of the distribution.\n",
    "   - **Lottery:** $\\text{E}[X^3] = (-1)^3 \\times 0.99 + 99^3 \\times 0.01 = 9,702$\n",
    "   - **Car Insurance:** $\\text{E}[X^3] = (-1)^3 \\times 0.99 + (-99)^3 \\times 0.01 = -9,702$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness and Its Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skewness** is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution. It's derived from the third standardized moment:\n",
    "  $$\\text{Skewness} = \\frac{\\text{E}[(X - \\mu)^3]}{\\sigma^3}$$\n",
    "  where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Positively Skewed:** If the skewness is greater than 0, the distribution has a longer tail on the right.\n",
    "  - **Negatively Skewed:** If the skewness is less than 0, the distribution has a longer tail on the left.\n",
    "  - **Symmetric:** If the skewness is 0, the distribution is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Your Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lottery (Positively Skewed):**\n",
    "  - The third moment ($9,702$) is positive, indicating that the distribution is positively skewed. This means that the distribution has a longer tail on the right, with more extreme positive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Car Insurance (Negatively Skewed):**\n",
    "  - The third moment ($-9,702$) is negative, indicating that the distribution is negatively skewed. This means that the distribution has a longer tail on the left, with more extreme negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Value:** Measures the average outcome, and in both scenarios, it is $0$.\n",
    "- **Variance:** Measures the spread around the mean, and both scenarios have the same variance of $99$.\n",
    "- **Third Moment (Skewness):** Measures the asymmetry of the distribution. For the lottery, the positive skewness indicates a higher chance of extreme positive outcomes. For the car insurance, the negative skewness indicates a higher chance of extreme negative outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the first and second moments are identical, the third moment helps to reveal the underlying risk profile and the distribution's asymmetry. Understanding skewness allows you to assess the potential for extreme outcomes, which is crucial for risk management and decision-making."

    "\n",
    "### Approximating the Probability Density Function (PDF) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with continuous data, the Probability Density Function (PDF) represents the underlying distribution of the data. Given a histogram of the data, which can be rough and discontinuous due to binning, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) offers a smooth approximation of the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to Perform Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plot the Histogram:**\n",
    "   - A histogram provides a rough idea of the data distribution by counting the number of observations within specified bins.\n",
    "   - For a small dataset, the histogram might show a jagged appearance due to the limited number of bins and data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply Kernel Density Estimation:**\n",
    "   - **Kernel Function:** Choose a kernel function to estimate the density. The Gaussian kernel is commonly used, but other kernel functions (e.g., Epanechnikov, Uniform) can be applied.\n",
    "   - **Bandwidth (σ):** The bandwidth parameter controls the width of the kernel function. A smaller bandwidth leads to a more sensitive estimate with potential overfitting, while a larger bandwidth produces a smoother estimate but may underfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Kernels for Each Data Point:**\n",
    "   - Place a kernel function (e.g., Gaussian curve) on top of each data point in your dataset.\n",
    "   - Each kernel function will spread out the influence of its corresponding data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combine Kernels:**\n",
    "   - Sum the contributions of all kernels.\n",
    "   - Normalize the sum so that the total area under the estimated density function equals one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualize the KDE:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Kernel Density Estimation:**\n",
    "   - Choose a Gaussian kernel function.\n",
    "   - Set a bandwidth parameter, say σ, to determine the spread of each Gaussian curve.\n",
    "   - Place a Gaussian curve on each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine Kernels:**\n",
    "   - Sum all Gaussian curves.\n",
    "   - Normalize the result to ensure the total area under the curve is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The final KDE plot will be a smooth curve that represents the estimated PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits of KDE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smooth Representation:** KDE provides a smooth estimate of the density function, avoiding the discontinuities seen in histograms.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** By adjusting the bandwidth, you can control the smoothness of the density estimate.\n",
    "- **Better Understanding:** KDE can reveal patterns and features in the data distribution that might be obscured by histogram binning.\n",

    "   - **Quartiles:** The edges of the box represent the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).\n",
    "   - **Whiskers:** Lines extending from the box show the range of the data, typically up to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from Q1 and Q3.\n",
    "   - **Outliers:** Points outside the whiskers are plotted individually as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Read a Violin Plot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shape of the Violin:** The width of the violin plot at different values reflects the density of the data. A wider section indicates a higher density of data points.\n",
    "- **KDE Curve:** Provides a smoothed view of the data distribution, showing the probability density.\n",
    "- **Box Plot Summary:** Offers a quick view of the median, quartiles, and range, helping to understand the spread and central tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a dataset with different groups or categories, you can create multiple violin plots side by side for each group. This allows you to compare distributions across groups in a visually informative way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a dataset comparing advertising budgets across different media (newspaper, TV, radio), you can create separate violin plots for each medium. This will show you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How each medium's budget distribution looks.\n",
    "- Where the density of budgets is highest.\n",
    "- The central tendency and spread of budgets for each medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of Violin Plots:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich Information:** Combines the benefits of box plots (summary statistics) and KDE (distribution shape).\n",
    "- **Comparative Insight:** Easily compare distributions between multiple groups or datasets.\n",
    "- **Detailed View:** Provides a detailed view of data density and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating a Violin Plot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data visualization libraries in Python, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, support creating violin plots. Here’s a basic example using Seaborn:\n"

    "## Visualizing data: QQ Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Normality: Using QQ Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether your data follows a normal distribution, QQ (Quantile-Quantile) plots are an effective and commonly used tool. Here’s a detailed overview of how QQ plots work and how you can interpret them:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What is a QQ Plot?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A QQ plot compares the quantiles of your data against the quantiles of a theoretical distribution, such as the normal distribution. The purpose is to visually assess if the data follows the specified distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps to Create and Interpret a QQ Plot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize the Data:**\n",
    "   - Subtract the mean of the data and divide by the standard deviation to standardize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Theoretical Quantiles:**\n",
    "   - For a standard normal distribution, calculate the quantiles that correspond to the percentiles of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Plot the Quantiles:**\n",
    "   - Plot the quantiles of the standardized data on the y-axis against the theoretical quantiles on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare with the Line:**\n",
    "   - If the data is normally distributed, the points should approximately lie on the 45-degree reference line (orange line).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpreting QQ Plots:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Points on the Line:**\n",
    "   - If the points closely follow the 45-degree line, it suggests that the data follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deviation from the Line:**\n",
    "   - Significant deviations from the line, especially in the tails, suggest that the data does not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skewness:**\n",
    "   - If points are curved away from the line, this may indicate skewness in the data. For example, if the points bend upwards at the ends, the data might be positively skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kurtosis:**\n",
    "   - Points that deviate from the line in the center may indicate that the data has excess kurtosis (i.e., heavier or lighter tails compared to a normal distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example of QQ Plot Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Newspaper Ad Budget Data:**\n",
    "  - If the QQ plot shows substantial deviations from the 45-degree line, especially at the tails, it indicates that the newspaper ad budget data does not follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales Data:**\n",
    "  - If the QQ plot for sales data shows points closely aligned with the 45-degree line, this suggests that the sales data is approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating a QQ Plot:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple example using Python’s `scipy` and `matplotlib` libraries:\n"

    "#### **1. Definitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X**: Discrete random variable representing the number rolled on the first die.\n",
    "- **Y**: Discrete random variable representing the sum of the numbers rolled on both dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Individual Probability Mass Functions (PMFs):**\n",

    "For a single die:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The possible outcomes are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\n",
    "- Each outcome has a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the PMF of X (or Y, if looking at a single die) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ for } x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Joint Probability Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the joint distribution, we consider both dice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **X** is the number rolled on the first die.\n",
    "- **Y** is the sum of the numbers rolled on both dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ can be described as $P(X = x, Y = y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Calculate the Joint Distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Possible Values for X and Y:**\n",
    "   - $X$ can be \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Joint Probability for Specific Pairs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The probability of each specific outcome (X, Y) is determined by counting the number of ways the dice can achieve that result and dividing by the total number of outcomes (36, since each die has 6 sides, leading to $6 \\times 6 = 36$ combinations).\n",
    "\n",
    "   For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Probability that $X = 3$ and $Y = 7$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "     To get $Y = 7$, the sum of the two dice must be 7. If $X = 3$, the second die must be $7 - 3 = 4$. \n",
    "\n",
    "     The outcome (3, 4) is one of the pairs that results in a sum of 7.\n",

    "\n",
    "     $$P(X = 3, Y = 7) = \\frac{1}{36}$$\n",

    "When dealing with continuous random variables, the concept of joint distribution becomes a bit different from the discrete case. Here’s a structured overview of how joint distributions work for continuous variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **X**: Waiting time before a call is picked up by a customer service agent (between 0 and 10 minutes).\n",
    "- **Y**: Customer satisfaction rating (between 0 and 10).\n",

    "Unlike discrete variables where probabilities are assigned to specific values, continuous variables deal with probability densities over intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Joint Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous variables, the joint distribution is described using a **joint probability density function (PDF)**, $f_{X,Y}(x, y)$. This function provides the density of probability at any point $(x, y)$ in the continuous space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To find the probability that $X$ falls within a certain range and $Y$ falls within a certain range, you integrate the joint PDF over the desired range:**\n",

    "\n",
    "     - $E(X^2) = 32.561$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean**: The average value around which the data points are centered.\n",
    "- **Variance**: Measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Joint Distribution Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-Density Regions**: Indicate where the joint probability density is higher, suggesting common pairs of $(X, Y)$ values.\n",
    "- **Low-Density Regions**: Indicate less common pairs of values.\n",

    "- **Independent Variables**:\n",
    "  - The joint distribution of independent variables is circular (or spherical in higher dimensions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dependent Variables**:\n",
    "  - The joint distribution is elongated along a line corresponding to the covariance between the variables. This can be visualized as ellipses in 2D or ellipsoids in higher dimensions.\n",
